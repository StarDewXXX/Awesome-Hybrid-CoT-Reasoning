> Hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is a novel technique designed to accelerate the reasoning process of large reasoning models. It aims to enable the model to dynamically select between Long-CoT and Short-CoT strategies based on the nature of the problem, achieving significantly greater speedup compared to alternative approaches.
